title: More Upfront, Less Available
tldr: I&rsquo;ve published my rate and limited my hours to 20 per week.
---

I've updated my [about page](/) to included some no-nonsense information on availability and pricing. It's a direct and transparent approach that I've been interested in adopting since hearing [Sam Soffes](http://samsoff.es) discuss it[^1] on [The Industry Radio Show](http://theindustry.cc/2012/05/01/8-adobe-html5rocks-dialoggs-invites-and-making-cheddar/). I'm excited to make this change. Here's what's new:

## Upfront Rate

$125/hr. $250/hr for PHP work[^2]. That's it. Neither me nor my clients have to worry about playing the negotiation game. Instead we can focus on what services I can provide within their budget.

## Minimum Commitment

20 hours minimum. This is rarely a problem, but projects big and small have overhead. I prefer to bill for coding tasks only. Four billable hours behind eight hours of project management and research quickly works against me.

## Maximum weekly hours

This is the biggest change. 20 hours of work per week maximum. I've been working full 40+ hour weeks since October of last year. It's time for me to pull back and start down a new path. This will give me time to focus on a product I'm developing, as well as finish some longstanding projects: Move Back to the United States&trade; and Get Married&trade;.

[^1]: Sam's hire page is no longer up since he's working on his own app, [Cheddar](https://cheddarapp.com/), full time. But you can still check out [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/samsoffes/hire.samsoff.es).

[^2]: This is meant to dissuade work in a technology I loathe. I picked this up from somebody on a podcast, but I can't remember which one or who said it. If anyone knows what I'm talking about please let me know.
